					Automatic Changes:
					==================
					
					Singularity adds the following new entity classes for use in AITask/AITarget properties:
				
						EntityAnimalChicken (inherits from EntityAnimalRabbit)
						
						EntityAnimalBear (inherits from EntityEnemyAnimal)
						EntityAnimalBoar (inherits from EntityEnemyAnimal)
						EntityAnimalMountainLion (inherits from EntityEnemyAnimal)
						
						EntityAnimalWolf (inherits from EntityEnemyAnimal)
							EntityAnimalCoyote (inherits from EntityAnimalWolf)
							
						EntityAnimalSupernatural (inherits from EntityEnemyAnimal)
							EntityAnimalBossGrace (inherits from EntityAnimalSupernatural)
							EntityAnimalDireWolf (inherits from EntityAnimalSupernatural)
							EntityAnimalZombieBear (inherits from EntityAnimalSupernatural)
							
						EntityZombieSmart (inherits from EntityZombie)
							EntityZombieScreamer (inherits from EntityZombieSmart)
							
					Note that these have no effect unless first declared in entity_classes as "Class" properties:
						
						<entity_class name="Platypus"/>
							<property name="Class" value="EntityAnimalChicken"/>
				-->
				
                <property name="ShaderlessFX" value="true"/>
				 <!-- 
					Adds two new screen effects: Singularity_Snapshot and Singularity_Overlay. They can be used via XML as ModifyScreenEffect triggered actions. Singularity_Snapshot takes a snapshot of the whole screen and applies it as an overlay. 
				 
						Example:
						<triggered_effect trigger="onSelfBuffStart" action="ModifyScreenEffect" fade="1" effect_name="Singularity_Snapshot"/>
				 
					Singularity_Overlay applies a uniform color overlay. By default the overlay will be white, but you can optionally declare a "color" attribute (rgba).
				 
						Examples:
						<triggered_effect trigger="onSelfBuffStart" action="ModifyScreenEffect" intensity="1" fade=".8" effect_name="Singularity_Overlay"/> 
						<triggered_effect trigger="onSelfBuffStart" action="ModifyScreenEffect" intensity=".5" fade="1" effect_name="Singularity_Overlay" color="FF0000"/> 
				 -->
                <property name="EntityStun" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					Any entity with a "Singularity_Stunned" CVar value greater than 0 will stop chasing and looking at other entities. They will still get alerted and even attack enemies within their reach, but they will not move from their position or turn to face them outside of that range. For compatibility between mods, it's recommended to use add and subtract operations instead of set (add 1 to initiate the stun, subtract 1 when done). 
				-->
                <property name="NonlethalExplosives" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					Adds a new "Singularity_IsNonlethalExplosive" property that can be added to explosives via XML to prevent them from dealing damage but still apply whatever buffs they have set in "Explosion.Buffs" to all targets within their blast radius (not ignoring cover). 
				-->
                <property name="AmmoSounds" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					Adds two new properties for ammo: "Singularity_Sound_start" and "Singularity_Sound_loop" that override the respective weapon sounds when using that ammo.
				-->
                <property name="EntityGregariousness" value="true"/>
				<!-- 
					Any entity_class with a Singularity_Gregariousness property will have a chance of assisting other entities of its class that are getting attacked nearby (normalized percentage from 0.0 to 1.0). Example with 50% chance:
					
					<append xpath="/entity_classes/entity_class[@name='animalBoar']">
						<property name="Singularity_Gregariousness" value="0.5"/>
					
					As of 1.2.0.0, this property also causes entities to more formally band together around a leader. Every time members wander too far away from their leaders, they eventually return (unless they're unable to do so for any reason, like dying).
					
					As of 1.3.0.0, the maximum size of each group of entities can also be specified in the following way (example with a max group size of 4):
					
					<append xpath="/entity_classes/entity_class[@name='animalBoar']">
						<property name="Singularity_GroupSize" value="4"/>
					
					This number represents slots for each leader of a group (counting the leader). Note that once group members die, their slots are NOT freed. This is on purpose, as it makes it more likely for multiple groups of different sizes (up to max) to exist simultaneously, instead of fewer large groups.
					
					Defaults to -1 (no group size limit).
				-->
                <property name="SetAsTargetIfHurt_BypassSameTypeCheck" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					This feature removes the requirement from SetAsTargetIfHurt AITarget tasks for entities to be of different entityType (enum).
				-->
                <property name="RunawayFromEntity_NoImplicitPlayer" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					This feature makes it so RunawayFromEntity doesn't automatically cause entities to run away from players. Players must then be declared explicitly in XML when that behavior is desired.
				-->
                <property name="SetNearestCorpseAsTarget_Filters" value="false"/>
				<!-- 
					Extends SetNearestCorpseAsTarget in the following ways:
					- Adds a class parameter to filter by entity class (much like SetNearestEntityAsTarget, but simpler syntax)
					- Adds a cannibalismChance parameter that gives each entity a chance of eating the remains of members of its own class (normalized percentage from 0.0 to 1.0). Defaults to 0.0 if not set (no cannibalism)
					
					Example:
					<property name="AITarget-1" value="SetNearestCorpseAsTarget" data="class=EntityAnimalRabbit,EntityAnimalBoar;cannibalismChance=0.20"/>
						
					The above example translates to: Entity will eat dead rabbits and boars nearby. If the entity itself is a rabbit or a boar, there will be a 20% chance it will be flagged as a cannibal upon spawning, and if so, it will eat the remains of other rabbits or boars, otherwise it won't.
